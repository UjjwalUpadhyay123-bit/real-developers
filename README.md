# real-developers

Do:
npm i
npm start

Some assumptions taken:

1. The Featured developers will contain the items from json which have developer key defined in each row.
2. The Trending Projects will contain the items from json which dont have developer keys defined.
3. There is a common form for add project and add developer. If developer name is given, it will be added to featured developers else it will be added to trending projects.
